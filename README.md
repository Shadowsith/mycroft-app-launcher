## App Launcher Skill
Execute and stop Linux desktop programs

## Description 
The App Launcher Skill allows to open and close linux desktop applications
with simple open/close commands. It is very similiar to [Desktop
Launcher](https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-desktop-launcher) from Mycroft but 
ony uses subprocesses to open/close programs. It also gives you a message if a
application is not found on the device.

* "Launch thunderbird"
* "Close firefox"
* "Exit thunderbird"

Clone this repository into /opt/mycroft/skills and restart the mycroft service
